# Pokedex-MDB-

This app implements the "Pokedex" from the Pokemon video games, up to generation 7. The user can search for specific pokemon via the search bar, search by their typing, or search by their stats. The pokemon will appear in a table view, where the user can scroll through all retrieved pokemon. When clicked on, a profile page will appear showing the stats of the pokemon.
